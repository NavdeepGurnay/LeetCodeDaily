Intuition
Draw array elements asa height of peaks in mountain valley.
Try to draw various edge cases as a mountains peaks.(first highest peak, middle highest peak, last peak as the highest)
because every time you start with something greater than previous element, there start a new subarray (new peak of the mountain) and we will start new addition of values.

Approach
Draw num values as peaks of the mountain, u will understand how it is actually working.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code
class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOperations(vector<int>& target) {
        int n = target.size();
        int ans = target[0];
        for(int i = 1;i<n;i++){
            // new peak start
            if(target[i] > target[i-1]){
                ans += target[i] - target[i-1];
                
            }
            
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
